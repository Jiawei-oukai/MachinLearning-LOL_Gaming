## Features Formula Explanation:
```
A. Championâ€™s Counter Score:
For Champion A vs B in this Position:
The counter score = 
âˆ‘ (Player Who Pick Champ A in This Position_gold)- âˆ‘ (Player Who Pick Champ B in This Position_gold) / Matches Champion A vs Champion B
For Champion B vs A in this Position: counter score = -(Counter Score A vs B)

B. Championâ€™s win rate
N_win = Number of matches the champion won
N = Total number of matches in which the hero Champion was picked
Nâ€™_win = Number of matches the champion won in that position(Top, Jungle , Mid, Bottom, Utility)
Nâ€™ = Total number of matches in which the hero Champion was picked in that position
championâ€™s overall win rate = N_win / N
championâ€™s win rate in each position = Nâ€™_win / Nâ€™
For rare champions with few matches at each position:
when the number of matches in which a hero is picked in that position is less than N/n (n = 160 , the number of all champions), we consider this champion to be a rare hero in that position and his win rate is inaccurate. 
We use the weighted average win rate in that position of all rare champions as the win rate of each rare champion in that position.

C. Championâ€™s attack/defense ability
For each match:
dmg_dealt = total damages dealt by the champion to others
dmg_taken = total damages received by the champion
dmg_dealt_per_min = dmg_dealt / gameDuration * 60
dmg_taken_per_min = dmg_taken / gameDuration * 60
championâ€™s attack ability = âˆ‘ dmg_dealt_per_min / N  (
championâ€™s defense ability = âˆ‘ dmg_taken_per_min / N  Teamâ€™s composition 
Mean_attack_ability = âˆ‘ championâ€™s attack ability / 5
Mean_defense_ability = âˆ‘ championâ€™s attack ability / 5
teamâ€™s composition = Mean_attack_ability - Mean_defense_ability

D. Championâ€™s control ability
For each match:
time_control = total time of crowd control inflicted to other champs (in seconds)
time_control_per_min = time_control / gameDuration * 60
championâ€™s control ability = âˆ‘ time_control / N
